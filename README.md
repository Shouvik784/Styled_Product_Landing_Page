Styled Product Landing Page Using HTML &amp; CSS

Incorporate different positioning schemes into your Product Landing Page:
1. Use relative positioning for an element that should move slightly.
2. Use absolute positioning for a floating action button that stays within a container but is positioned to the bottom-right corner.
3. Add a fixed navigation bar that remains at the top of the page while scrolling.
